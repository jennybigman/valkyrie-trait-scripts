# number of batches calculations 

	# goal is to calculate the average number of batches for a species that is representative of
	# each functional group in Valkyrie; initial list of species with data on spawning frequency
	# came from Table 1 in Marshall, D. J., Barneche, D. R., & White, C. R. (2022). 
	# How does spawning frequency scale with body size in marine fishes?. 
	# Fish and Fisheries, 23(2), 316-323. We picked representatives from Table 1 for each functional
	# group and went back to the cited paper for that species to get the number of batches. We then
	# took the average as a placeholder for number of batches for that group.
